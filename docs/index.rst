FFTX documentation
==================

FFTX is the exascale follow-on to the `FFTW <https://fftw.org>`_
open-source package for executing the discrete Fast Fourier
Transform, as well as higher-level operations composed of FFTs
and linear operators.
It is based on `SPIRAL <https://www.spiral.net>`_,
a build-time code generator that produces
high-performance kernels targeted to specific uses and platform
environments.

FFTX is being developed as a cooperative effort between Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, and
SpiralGen, Inc.
