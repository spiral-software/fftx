Python Package for FFTX
=======================

The `Python Package for FFTX <https://github.com/spiral-software/python-package-fftx>`_
provides NumPy/CuPy-compatible access to the high performance
multi-platform code generation capabilities of FFTX.
For more information on how to install and use it, see its
github repository:

https://github.com/spiral-software/python-package-fftx

The Python Package for FFTX depends on SPIRAL,
but is separate from and does *not* require the FFTX C++-based repo.
