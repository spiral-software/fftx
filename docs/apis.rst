FFTX interfaces
---------------

The FFTX interfaces operate on constructs in
``namespace fftx``.
A multi-dimensional array is represented by an instance of
:ref:`struct array_t <fftx_array_t>`,
which is defined by its domain as an instance of
:ref:`struct box_t <fftx_box_t>`,
which in turn is defined by its corners, which are instances of
:ref:`struct point_t <fftx_point_t>`.
An array instance also contains a pointer to the data, an instance of
:ref:`class global_ptr <fftx_global_ptr>`.

The class :ref:`FFTXProblem <FFTXProblem>` defines an FFTX problem
of a particular transform type of a particular size.
