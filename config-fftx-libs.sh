##  Set options for building the various FFTX libraries.  These are used to drive what is
##  built for FFTX -- libraries are generated first, then an options configuration CMake
##  file is built to drive what CMake builds (e.g., some examples cannot be built unless
##  all the pre-requisite libraries are built).

##  Whenever a library is built both the forward and inverse transforms (when applicable)
##  are built
##  Build the batch 1D DFT (complex to complex) library
DFTBAT_LIB=true

##  Build the batch 1D packed real DFT (real to complex, complex to real) library
PRDFTBAT_LIB=true

##  Build the 3D DFT (complex to complex) library
MDDFT_LIB=true

##  Build the 3D DFT (real to complex, complex to real) library
MDPRDFT_LIB=true

##  Build the Real Convolution library
RCONV_LIB=true

##  Build the MPI distributed FFT library (MPI is required to build examples)
DISTDFT_LIB=true

##  File containing the sizes to build for the CPU version of MDDFT, MDPRDFT, and RCONV
CPU_SIZES_FILE="cube-sizes-cpu.txt"

##  File containing the sizes to build for the GPU version of MDDFT, MDPRDFT, and RCONV
GPU_SIZES_FILE="cube-sizes-gpu.txt"

##  File containing the sizes to build for the CPU version of batch 1D DFT and batch 1D PRDFT
DFTBAT_SIZES_FILE="dftbatch-sizes.txt"

##  File containing the sizes to build for the CPU version of batch 1D DFT and batch 1D PRDFT
DISTDFT_SIZES_FILE="distdft-sizes.txt"

##  Build all examples: If set true the FFTX example programs will be built.  NOTE: Only
##  those example programs which have their dependent libraries will be built.  Some
##  examples do not depend on any of the libraries and these will also be built.  When the
##  flag is set to false, NO example programs will be built.
BUILD_EXAMPLES=true

##Build FFTX for CPU
BUILD_FOR_CPU=false

##  Build FFTX for CUDA
BUILD_FOR_CUDA=false

##  Build FFTX for HIP
