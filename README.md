## Building FFTX

### Prerequisites

There are several pre-requisites that must be installed prior to building and
using **FFTX**.  You will need:

* **CMake**, minimum version 3.14; however, a more-modern version is preferred
as some deprecated features must be used with older versions.
* if on Linux/Unix, **gcc** and **make**.
* if on Windows, **Visual Studio**, and an ability to run **bash** shell
scripts.  You can use the Git Bash shell available with **git**, but other
shells such as Cygwin or msys will also work.
* if on macOS, version 10.14 (Mojave) or later of macOS, with a compatible
version of **Xcode** and **Xcode Command Line Tools**.
* **python**, version 3.6 or higher.  On some systems, both **python** (usually
version 2.7) and **python3** exist.  The scripts used to create the **FFTX** library
source code check the version of **python**, and if it is version 2.X it will
try to run **python3** instead.  A user, therefore, should not have to worry
whether **python** or **python3** comes first in the user's path.

### Summary

A brief summary of the steps necessary to install FFTX follows; these steps outline the
most straight forward case (building for CPU only), for more complex installs and to
utilize GPUs please follow the more detailed instructions below. 

```
1.  Make a directory to hold the download code and cd to it (e.g., mkdir ~/work ; cd ~/work)
2.  git clone https://github.com/spiral-software/fftx
3.  cd fftx
4.  export FFTX_HOME=`pwd`
5.  unset SPIRAL_HOME
6.  source ./get_spiral.sh
7.  ./config-fftx-libs.sh 
8.  mkdir build
9.  cd build/
10. cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FFTX_HOME -D_codegen=CPU ..
11. make install -j
```

To build and use **FFTX**, including how to utilize GPUs, please follow these steps:
1. [Install **SPIRAL** and associated packages.](#1-install-spiral-and-associated-packages)
2. [Clone the **FFTX** repository.](#2-clone-the-fftx-repository)
3. [Generate library source code.](#3-generate-library-source-code)
4. [Compile library source code and examples.](#4-compile-library-source-code-and-examples)

### 1. Install SPIRAL and associated packages

If you already have SPIRAL installed (and have the **SPIRAL_HOME** environment variable
set) FFTX will use that installation and you can skip to [step 2, "Clone the FFTX repository"](#2-clone-the-fftx-repository).

If you want to manually install SPIRAL follow the steps below; alternatively, skip to
[step 2, "Clone the FFTX repository"](#2-clone-the-fftx-repository) and have FFTX pull down the necessary SPIRAL repositories and
perform the build steps.

Clone **spiral-software** (available [**here**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software))
to a location on your computer.  E.g.,:
```
cd ~/work
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software
```
This location is known as *SPIRAL HOME*, and you must set an environment variable
**SPIRAL_HOME** (here, **`~/work/spiral-software`**) to point to this location later.

**FFTX** requires the **SPIRAL** packages
[**fftx**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-fftx),
[**simt**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-simt),
[**mpi**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-mpi), and
[**jit**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-jit).

You need to download these separately, as follows:
```
cd $SPIRAL_HOME/namespaces/packages
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-fftx fftx
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-simt simt
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-mpi mpi
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-jit jit
```
**NOTES:**
* The **SPIRAL** packages must be installed under directory **$SPIRAL_HOME/namespaces/packages**
and must be placed in folders with the prefix *spiral-package-* removed. 
* If you already have **spiral-software** installed, please refresh the
installation to ensure you're up-to-date, especially for the **SPIRAL** packages.
* It is preferable to download the **SPIRAL** packages *before* performing
the **SPIRAL** build steps.

Follow the build instructions for **spiral-software** (see the **README**
[**here**](https://github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software/blob/master/README.md) ).

### 2. Clone the FFTX repository.

Clone **FFTX** to a location on your computer.  E.g.,
```
cd ~/work
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/fftx
cd fftx
```
Set the environment variable **FFTX_HOME** to point to the directory where
you want to install **FFTX** (which is not necessarily the same directory
where you have cloned **FFTX**; you may want to have separate installation
directories for different backends).

If you have not already installed SPIRAL and the SPIRAL packages required for FFTX, you can have them downloaded and built from the
repositories by sourcing the **get_spiral.sh** shell script now.  This script checks the
definition of the **SPIRAL_HOME** environment variable, and if undefined it will get the
SPIRAL code, build it and export a definition for **SPIRAL_HOME**.  Make sure you source
(vs. run) the script:
```
. ./get_spiral.sh
```
or
```
source get_spiral.sh
```

### 3. Generate library source code.

**FFTX** builds libraries of transforms for a set of different sizes.  The library source
code is generated from **SPIRAL** script specifications, and must be created before
building **FFTX** itself.  For the sizes that are pre-built the code will be added to
libraries (the pre-defined fixed-size libraries).  Alternatively, sizes not defined can
have the code generated and compiled at run-time (RTC).

Before creating the library source code consider if you will be running on CPU only, or
also utilizing a GPU.  If you create all the source code (and related **cmake** scripts
and library APIs) for GPU and then try building for CPU only you may encounter compiler
errors or unexpected results.  It is recommended that you have separate installs for CPU
and GPU.

The shell script **config-fftx-libs.sh** is a utility script in the **FFTX** home
directory that marshals resources for building the libraries and examples.  There is a
flag that enables or disables the building of examples (enabled by default).  NOTE: All
libraries **should be created**; creating the library is a pre-requisite to creating its
API files (files which are required later when building the RTC code).  Building the
examples may be turned off if you only need to build the libraries for an external
application).  The script is self-documenting; typically it should not be edited (unless
you need to disable building the examples).

NOTE: It is required that you build all libraries (even if you add few or no
fixed size entries to the library).  This is because the API header files are created
automatically at build time.  At run time the API can check if a specific transform of the
requested size exists in the library and use it if it exists.  If it doesn't exist then
the desired transform can be generated and compiled on-the-fly (RTC).

Run the script as follows:
```
./config-fftx-libs.sh <platform>
##  where <platform> is one of { CPU [default] | CUDA | HIP }
```
If no argument is provided, then the platform defaults
to CPU.  This script runs the **build-lib-code.sh** script in the **src/library**
directory and will marshal the resources and options needed for the set of libraries.
This step can take quite some time depending on the number of transforms and set of sizes
to create.  The code is targeted to run on a CPU or a GPU (either CUDA or HIP) depending
on the platform specified with the script.  By default, only a small number of fixed sizes
will be created for the fixed-size libraries.

The text file **`build-lib-code-failures.txt`** will contain a list of any library
transforms that failed to generate in this step.

Running **config-fftx-libs.sh** also creates a file called **options.cmake**.  The options
defined in this file are used by **CMake** to determine what is actually compiled at build
time.

### 4. Compile library source code and examples.

From your **FFTX** home directory, set up a **build** folder (which can be given any name,
and you may want to have separate ones for different backends).  When you configure using
**CMake** you must specify the install prefix that **CMake** should use (the system
default location for **CMake** may be a directory for which you do not have write
privileges).  Do that by setting the environment variable **FFTX_HOME** and specifying
either the directory path or the environment variable on the **CMake** command line.

**NOTES:**
* You will need **FFTX_HOME** set in order to use or reference **FFTX** artifacts externally.<br>
* **FFTX_HOME** may be, but does not have to be, the same as your **FFTX** home directory.
* Some tips for building on a supercomputing platform at NERSC or OLCF are available
[**here**.](https//github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software/blob/master/supercomputer-README.md)

```
export FFTX_HOME=~/work/fftx
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/work/fftx -D_codegen=CPU ..      # build for CPU, *or*
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FFTX_HOME  -D_codegen=CUDA ..     # build for CUDA, *or*
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/work/fftx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc -D_codegen=HIP ..      # build for HIP
make install
```

When **FFTX** is built, the final step (of *make install*) creates a tree structure
(at the location specified by **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**).  The following
directories will be created/populated:

|Directory Name|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**./CMakeIncludes**|CMake include files and functions to ease integration with **FFTX**|
|**./bin**|Executables for example programs built as part of the **FFTX** distribution|
|**./lib**|**FFTX** libraries, that can be called by external applications|
|**./include**|Include files for using **FFTX** libraries|
|**./cache_jit_files**|Folder containing the RTC code generated for any transform not <br>found in a fixed-size library|

### Building on Windows

**FFTX** can be built on Windows, however, you need to be able to run a [bash]
shell script as mentioned above to build the library source code.  To build
**FFTX**, open a shell and do the following:
```
cd fftx
./config-fftx-libs.sh <platform> where <platform> is one of { CPU [default] | CUDA | HIP }
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/work/fftx -D_codegen=CUDA ..
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```
This shows an example building for CUDA on Windows, you can also build for CPU
or AMD HIP as shown above (under Building for Linux).

## Running FFTX Example Programs

After building **FFTX**, to run the programs that are in the **examples** subtree, simply do:
```
cd $FFTX_HOME/bin
./testcompare_device
./testverify
```
etc.  Since we set **RPATH** to point to where the libraries are installed, you
likely will not need to adjust the library path variable, typically
**LD_LIBRARY_PATH**.

NOTE: On Windows **RPATH** does not work correctly.  If you encounter "missing library"
errors when trying to run add the directory containing the installed libraries to your
**PATH**.

The README in the **examples** folder
[**here**](https://github.com/spiral-software/fftx/blob/master/examples/README.md)
contains a list of examples, how to run them, and how to add a new example.  More details
about individual examples may be found in the individual example folder's README file.

## Libraries

The libraries built and copied to the **$FFTX_HOME/lib** folder can be used by
external applications to leverage **FFTX** transforms.  To access the necessary
include files and libraries, an external application's **CMakeLists.txt** should
include **CMakeInclude/FFTXCmakeFunctions.cmake**.  A full example of an
external application linking with **FFTX** libraries is available in the
[**fftx-demo-extern-app**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/fftx-demo-extern-app).

### FFTX Libraries Built

**FFTX** builds libraries for 1D and 3D FFTs for a single device.  FFTs are
built for a set of specific sizes, thus not all possible sizes will be found in
the libraries.  There are default files specifying the sizes to build for each
of: 1D FFTs and 3D FFTs (default file names below).  You can
customize the set of sizes to build by either editing these files **or** provide
your own files -- just override the default file name in the
**config-fftx-libs.sh** script.  If you provide your own file(s) just follow the
format shown in the default file(s).  The default files specifying the sizes to
build for each group of transforms are (all files are in the src/library
folder):

|Type|File Name|Description|
|:-----:|:-----|:-----|
|1D FFT|dftbatch-sizes.txt|Batch of 1D FFTs|
|3D FFT|cube-sizes-cpu.txt|3D FFTs for CPU| 
|3D FFT|cube-sizes-gpu.txt|3D FFTs for GPU| 

The following is a list of the libraries built:

|Type|Name|Description|
|:-----:|:-----|:-----|
|3D FFT|fftx_mddft|Forward 3D FFT complex to complex|
|3D FFT|fftx_imddft|Inverse 3D FFT complex to complex|
|3D FFT|fftx_mdprdft|Forward 3D FFT real to complex|
|3D FFT|fftx_imdprdft|Inverse 3D FFT complex to real|
|3D Convolution|fftx_rconv|3D real convolution|
|1D FFT|fftx_dftbat|Forward batch of 1D FFT complex to complex|
|1D FFT|fftx_idftbat|Inverse batch of 1D FFT complex to complex|
|1D FFT|fftx_prdftbat|Forward batch of 1D FFT real to complex (in development)|
|1D FFT|fftx_iprdftbat|Inverse batch of 1D FFT complex to real (in development)|

### Library API

The following example shows usage of the 3D FFT complex-to-complex transform
(others are similar; just use the appropriate names and header file(s) from the
table above).  The user (calling application) is responsible for setting up
memory buffers and allocations as required (i.e., host memory for serial code,
device memory for GPU code).  The following abstract assumes device memory
buffers are already allocated/initialized as needed; error checking is omitted
for clarity and brevity:

```
#include "fftx3.hpp"
#include "transformlib.hpp"

    std::vector<int> sizes{ mm, nn, kk };         // 'cube' dimensions
    std::vector<void *> args{ dY, dX, dsym };     // pointers to the Output, Input, and symbol arrays

    MDDFTProblem mdp ( args, sizes, "mddft" );    // Define transform

    mdp.transform();                              // Run the transform
```

If the size specified with the transform definition is found in a library then that code
is executed; however, if it is not found in  a library then RTC is invoked to generate and
compile the necessary code (this is also cached for future use).

### Linking Against FFTX Libraries

**FFTX** provides a **cmake** include file, **FFTXCmakeFunctions.cmake**, that
provides functions to facilitate compiling and linking external applications
with the **FFTX** libraries.  An external application should include this file
(**$FFTX_HOME/CMakeIncludes/FFTXCmakeFunctions.cmake**) in order to access the
following helper functions to compile/link with the **FFTX** libraries.  Two
functions are available:

1.  **FFTX_add_includes_libs_to_target** ( target ) -- This function adds the
include file paths, the linker library path, and the library names to the
specified target.
2.  **FFTX_find_libraries**() -- This function finds the **FFTX** libraries, linker
library path, and include file paths and exposes the following variables:

|CMake Variable Name|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**FFTX_LIB_INCLUDE_PATHS**|Include paths for **FFTX** include & library headers|
|**FFTX_LIB_NAMES**|List of **FFTX** libraries|
|**FFTX_LIB_LIBRARY_PATH**|Path to libraries (for linker)|

An application will typically need only call
**FFTX_add_includes_libs_to_target**(), and let **FFTX** handle the assignment
of paths, etc. to the target.  Only if an application specifically needs to
access the named variables above is it necessary to call
**FFTX_find_libraries**().

### External Application Linking With FFTX

A complete example of an external application that builds test programs utilizing the
**FFTX** libraries is available at
[**fftx-demo-extern-app**](https://www.github.com/spiral-software/fftx-demo-extern-app).
If you're interested in how to link an external application with **FFTX** please download
this example and review the **`CMakeLists.txt`** therein for specific details.  As an
example, in brief, the required steps to add the Poisson test program (using **cmake**)
are:

```
set ( POISSON1_TEST poissonTest )

##  FFTX_HOME must be defined in the environment or on the command line
if ( DEFINED ENV{FFTX_HOME} )
    message ( STATUS "FFTX_HOME = $ENV{FFTX_HOME}" )
    set ( FFTX_SOURCE_DIR $ENV{FFTX_HOME} )
else ()
    if ( "x${FFTX_HOME}" STREQUAL "x" )
        message ( FATAL_ERROR "FFTX_HOME environment variable undefined and not specified on command line" )
    endif ()
    set ( FFTX_SOURCE_DIR ${FFTX_HOME} )
endif ()

##  Include FFTX CMake functions
include ( "${FFTX_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeIncludes/FFTXCmakeFunctions.cmake" )

add_executable          ( ${POISSON1_TEST} ${POISSON1_TEST}.cpp )
target_link_libraries   ( ${POISSON1_TEST} PRIVATE dl )

FFTX_add_includes_libs_to_target ( ${POISSON1_TEST} )
```

The Poisson test program is a CPU only sample program using the FFTX library and RTC
interfaces.  When the program is run it accepts a single argument, **nx**, that specifies
the dimension of a cube to test.  If no argument is provided, a default value of **128**
is used.  The program may be run for different size cubes as follows:

```
poissonTest             ## defaults to 128^8; runs codegen
poissonTest -nx 80      ## Size 80^3, is present in the FFTX libraries
poissonTest -nx 64      ## Size 64^3, is present in the FFTX libraries
poissonTest -nx 224     ## Size 224^3; runs codegen
```

For sizes in the FFTX libraries the program calls into the library and runs immediately.
For sizes not in the libraries, **Spiral** is run to generate the required source code,
which is then compiled into a temporary library and executed.  The source code is cached
(meaning that if the specific size is run again, **Spiral** is not required as the source
code is reused).
