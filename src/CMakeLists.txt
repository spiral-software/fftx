project ( src )

##  The main folder with source code is the 'library' folder, from which the various transform libraries are generated.

##  All examples are expected to support CPU code generation, and ultimately
##  most (if not all) will support GPU code generation also.  Call
##  manage_add_subdir with the directory name and True/False for building for
##  CPU and GPU.  Building for GPU will build for the GPU type (e.g., CUDA or
##  HIP) depending on the toolchain/compilers present

##                  subdir name   CPU       GPU
